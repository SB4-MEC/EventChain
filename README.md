## Introduction

Welcome to our **Decentralized Event Ticketing Application** built on the Ethereum blockchain! This innovative application revolutionizes event ticketing by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. While primarily designed for event ticketing, its flexible nature allows it to be utilized for various other purposes as well.

Our platform enables seamless ticket booking for events, and once a ticket is booked, a confirmation email is automatically sent to the provided email address. The email contains a unique redeem ID that serves as an electronic ticket, ensuring secure and efficient event access.

The application is powered by Truffle, which facilitates smart contract development, deployment, and management on the local blockchain Ganache. The front-end is built using React.js to provide a smooth and user-friendly experience. We've integrated the Email.js service for email activities, ensuring reliable email delivery for event confirmations.
